            <h3>WHAT IS THE TERM SKINCARE???</h3>
            <p>
              Skin care is the range of practices that support skin integrity, enhance its appearance and relieve skin conditions. They can include nutrition, avoidance of excessive sun exposure and appropriate use of emollients.
      </p>
            <h3>DIFFERENT SKIN TYPES</h3>
            <p>
              There are five common skin types: normal, oily, dry, combination and sensitive. Blotting a clean tissue on your face in the morning is an easy way to find out your skin type.
<br />
              <br />
              A normal skin type has good circulation and there will not be any trace of sebum (or oil) on the tissue. Normal skin is soft, with a smooth, even skin tone.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className="pb-3 fadeIn wow col-lg-6"></div>
          <div className="pb-3 fadeIn wow col-lg-6"></div>
          <div className="pb-3 fadeIn wow col-lg-6">
            <p>
              An oily skin type will leave blots of facial oil on the tissue, particularly from the cheeks, nose and forehead. This type of skin has overactive sebaceous glands, producing more oil than necessary. Oily skin can be caused by hereditary factors, diet, hormone levels, pregnancy, unsuitable cosmetics and stress, leading to acne flare ups and enlarged pores. It is vital to thoroughly clean the skin regularly with gentle, soap-free cleansers.
            </p>
            <p>
              A dry skin type has a low level of sebum and does not maintain oil easily. Dry skin is often flaky and feels tight after being wiped. Gentle cleansing and a rich protective moisturiser for dry skin is essential to control that tight, uncomfortable feeling. It may be necessary to adjust your dry skin moisturiser for the changing seasons With.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className="pb-3 fadeIn wow col-lg-6">
            <p>

              A combination skin type oil is produced around the 'T-zone' of the  nose and forehead but not on the cheeks, mouth and eye areas. The best skin care for combination skin will involve treating each region differently.
<br />
              <br />

              Having a sensitive skin type can mean different things to different people. It can be caused by skin conditions such as rosacea, eczema or allergies. Sensitive skin can become inflamed and irritated easily. It is important to choose the right skin care products for sensitive skin because many cleansers and moisturisers contain ingredients that can cause an adverse reactions to this skin..
